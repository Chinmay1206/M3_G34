# Abstact:

Over 70% of the vehicles made today come with a remote keyless entry (RKE) system either standard or as an option. RKE systems are also a high volume after-market accessory. Most remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors and trunk. Some include remote start and car finder functions.


# About:

Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) systems represent the standard solution for conveniently locking and unlocking a vehicleâ€™s doors and luggage compartment by remote control. The anti-theft and immobilizer systems can also be turned on and off in this way.

# Features : 

 *  Lock the car when Button is pressed one time.
 *  Unlock the car when Button is pressed two time.
 *  activation/deactivation alarm when the Button is pressed three times.
 *  approach light when the Button is pressed four times.

# 4W and 1H :
  # Who :
   * One who is owner of the vehicle
 # What :
   * Keyless entry systems are used to remotely lock, unlock, alarm and can have various features.
 # When :
   * It will work within a range of distance a button is pushed, it sends a coded signal by radio waves to a receiver unit in the car, which locks or unlocks the door And do the task require.
 # Why :
   * Remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors
 # How :
   * Keyless entry to a vehicle is usually attained by sending a radio frequency signal from a remote transmitter to the receiver in the car.
 
 # SWOT Analysis:

 # Strength 
  * No need of human interaction required.
  * Optimized power and range and Advance security.

 # Weakness
  * Limitted usage Range.
  * it consist of electronic components which may damge easly when drop on hard surface.
  * 
 # Opportunities
  * Huge scope  in automobile industry.
  * Also allow users to use their smartphones as keys and we can controlling extra features like remote start from anywhere within range.

 # Threats
  * WE have to wait to make next task untill first action is completed.
  * Chances of theft.

# High Level Requirements :

|ID|	Description|
|---|---|
|HLR1|	It should lock the car door.|
|HLR2|	It should unlock the car door.|
|HLR3|	It alarm should ring for security purpose.|
|HLR4|	The aproach light should glow.|
|HLR5|  The System should be hack proof.|

# Low Level Requirements :
| ID | Decription|
|---|---|
|LLR1| If button is pressed once all LED's Shall blink.|
|LLR2| If button is pressed twice LED's shall be off.|
|LLR3| If button is pressed thrice LED's Shall glow in clockwise manner and alaram is activated.|
|LLR4| If button is pressed Four times LED's shall glow in anticlockwise manner & approach light glow.|
|LLR5| the should be provided with safety pupose to ensure the more secuirty.|

# Applications:

* commonplace devices.
* provide car owners with a degree of convenience, making the task of physically inserting a key unnecessary.
* A passive keyless entry (PKE) system uses advanced technology to take vehicle accessibility to a higher level.
* If someone tries to unclock Without pressing key bottons or key alarms get activated and user gets aware of the  thief.
  
# Test Plan & Output:

# High level test plan:

|Test ID|	Description|	Input|	Expected output|	Actual output|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|01|	Lock	|User presses button once|	Lock the car|	Lock the car|
|02|	Unlock|	User presses button twice|	Unlock the car|	Unlock the car|
|03|	Alarm Activate/Deactivate|	User presses button three times|	Activate or Deactivate alarm|	Activate or Deactivate alarm|
|04|	Approach light|	User presses button four times	|Turn on approach light|	Turn on approach light|

# Low Level Test Plan:

|Test ID|	Description|	Input|	Expected output	|Actual output|	Passed Or Failed|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|01|	check for lock|	User presses button once|	All LEDs should on|	All LEDs on| 	Pass|
|02|  Check for unlock|	User presses button twice|	All LEDs should off|	All LEDs off|	Pass|
|03|  Check for alarm activate/deactivate|	User presses button thrice|	LEDs should on in clockwise direction|	LEDs on in clockwisedirection| Pass|
|04|	Check for approach light|	User presses button four times|	LEDs should on in anticlockwise direction|	LEDs  on in  anticlockwiseDirection|	Pass|
  
# Best Methods Followed :

* Exact Mapping of code to avoid confusions
* Mentioning of both High level and Low level Behavioral and structural diagrams for better understanding
* Followed the exact symbols to make the understanding easier
* Detailed explanation in Low level Behavioural and Structural Diagrams
* Also detailed explanation of test plan output given for checking the output.

# Goals of this project :

- **_To reduce the human effort_**
- **_To provide better & quicker unlocking technique_**
